# Car-Price_prediction
I have made a machine learning model which predicts the price of car using features like years, km driven, transmission type, fuel type, brand.
Technologies that I have used in this project are :- python and libraries(pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn), streamlit, jupyter notebook.
The accuracy of This model is approx 90%.
